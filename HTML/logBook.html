<h3>May 19th</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Creation of the logBook button (...In fact, a clickable picture)</li>
    <li>UI Test : Implementation with Cucumber/Selenium</li>
    <span class="GherkinText">Scenario:</span> The logbook picture must load logBook.html in the main frame<br>
    <span class="GherkinText">When</span> I click on the logbook picture<br>
    <span class="GherkinText">Then</span> the main frame must contain LogBook
</ul>
<h3>May 20th</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Since yesterday, I was stuck in the previous test due to asynchronous issue with Javascript and its promises.</li>
    <li>Thanks to <a href="http://testerstories.com/2016/03/webdriver-in-javascript-with-promises/" target="_blank">this</a>
        article, I finally understood the promises concept and achieve the test of the logBook button.</li>
    <li>Code is available on my github
        <a href="https://github.com/nabil-hammami/my_site/blob/master/FEATURES/step_definitions/UI_stepdef.js" target="_blank">here</a></li>
    <li>Next step : Integration in Jenkins : OK</li>
</ul>
<h3>May 21st</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Issue with the driver.close() instruction with Selenium has been solved by putting it in an AFTER hook.</li>
    <li>Cucumber Html Reporter is up and running, reports are available from the (temporary) menu.</li>
    <li>Now, I must check, why Jenkins doesn't want to automatically execute the HTML reporter after each build.</li>
    <li>Also added a link to the roadmap.</li>
</ul>
