<h1>Logbook</h1>
<h2>To track the progression </h2>
<h3>On going</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Issue with the driver.close() instruction with Selenium has been solved by putting it in an AFTER hook.</li>
    <li>Cucumber Html Reporter is up and running, reports are available from the (temporary) menu.</li>
    <li><s>Now, I must check, why Jenkins doesn't want to automatically execute the HTML reporter after each build.</s><br>
    It was because Jenkins allow only 1 command in each batch in the build section.</li>
    <li>Also added a link to the roadmap.</li>
</ul>
