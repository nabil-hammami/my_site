    <h1>Welcome</h1>
    <p style="white-space: pre">Hi, my name's Nabil</p>
    <p>I've done this website to play with various tools, approaches, and programming languages related to the testing
        world.</p>
    <p>I'll use this website as a portal to my different projects.</p>
    <p>The <b>Projects</b> section contain the list of my various projects with explanations.</p>
    <p>In the <b>Roadmap</b> section, I'll keep track off the next steps.</p>
    <p><b>Latest test results</b> section contain ... mmmhhh...in fact, I think it doesn't need to be explained.</p>
    <p>Finally, I use the <b>Logbook</b> section to follow my progress on the ongoing task, which is (normally) the
        first one in the roadmap.</p>
